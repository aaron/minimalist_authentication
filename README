MinimalistAuthentication
========================

A Rails authentication plugin that takes a minimalist approach. It is designed to be simple to understand, use, and modify for your application.

This plugin was largely inspired by the restful-authentication plugin (http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/master). I selected the essential methods for password based authentication, reorganized them, trimmed them down when possible, added a couple of features, and resisted the urge to start adding more.


Installation
============
script/plugin install git://github.com/aaron/minimalist_authentication.git

ruby script/generate scaffold user active:boolean email:string crypted_password:string salt:string last_logged_in_at:datetime


Example
=======

app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Minimalist::Authentication
end

app/controllers/application.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Minimalist::Authorization
  
  # Lock down everything by default
  # use skip_before_filter to open up sepecific actions
  prepend_before_filter :authorization_required
end

app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  include Minimalist::Sessions
  skip_before_filter :authorization_required, :only => [:new, :create]
end

test/test_helper.rb
class Test::Unit::TestCase
  include Minimalist::TestHelper
end
